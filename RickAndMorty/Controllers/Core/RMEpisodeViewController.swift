/*


-> Create Episode Tab Section


RMEpisodeViewController ) Thankfull we designed our application to have small ViewControllers.
Being that they are small, we are able to copy and paste them around our code.

We will also need to conform to the RMEpisodeListViewDelegate.



rmEpisodeListView ) Our rmEpisodeListView() Function is going to create an RMEpisodeDetailViewController instance with the episode argument's url.

We will then push to the RMEpisodeDetailViewController.

Head over to RMEpisodeListView.
