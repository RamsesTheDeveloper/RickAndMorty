    override func viewDidLoad() {

view.backgroundColor ) We are going to support both light mode and dark mode, so we are going to set the value of view.backgroundColor equal to .systemBackground.



title ) The title property is used to set the title of the ViewController's NavigationBar.

-> RMRequest Section


Testing Endpoints ) To test our endpoints, we ran this code inside of RMCharacterViewController's viewDidLoad() Function :

    let request = RMRequest(endpoint: .location)
    print(request.url)

Note that we ran this test for all of our cases, not just .location.



Testing RMRequest ) To test our RMRequest Type, we ran this code inside of RMCharacterViewController's viewDidLoad() Function :

    let request = RMRequest(endpoint: .character, pathComponents: ["1"])
    print(request.url)
 
    let request = RMRequest(endpoint: .character, queryParameters: [
    URLQueryItem(name: "name", value: "rick"),
    URLQueryItem(name: "status", value: "Alive")]
    )
    print(request.url)


Testing RMService ) To test RMService's execute Function, we ran this code inside of RMCharacterViewController's viewDidLoad() Function :

    let request = RMRequest(endpoint: .character, queryParameters: [
        URLQueryItem(name: "name", value: "rick"),
        URLQueryItem(name: "status", value: "alive")
    ])

    RMService.shared.execute(request, expecting: RMCharacter.self) { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(RMCharacter)
        }
    }

Notice that we passed in the Type that we were expecting to the execute() Function, in this case that Type is RMCharacter.self.

When we receive our result in the .success case, we are given an RMCharacter.
The reason that our execute() Function asks for the Type we are expecting and returns that Type is because we passed a Generic into the execute() Function.

DoCatch Test ) We are testing that our do statement is running correctly, the do statement was created within our RMService's execute() Function.

The do statement should print a JSON object to the console when the execute() Function runs.
We are going to switch on the result and break on the success case, if we receive and error, we are going to print out a String describing that failure :

    let request = RMRequest(endpoint: .character, queryParameters: [
        URLQueryItem(name: "name", value: "rick"),
        URLQueryItem(name: "status", value: "alive")
    ])

    print(request.url)

    RMService.shared.execute(request, expecting: RMCharacter.self) { result in
        switch result {
        case .success:
            break
        case .failure(let error):
            print(String(describing: error))
        }
    }

The reason that we are breaking in the success case instead of doing something with the data is because we are testing to see if our do statement is going to print out a JSON object.

The test succeeded.



RMGetAllCharactersResponse ) To test out the RMGetAllCharactersResponse Model, we ran this code inside of the viewDidLoad() Function :

RMService.shared.execute(.listCharactersRequests, expecting: RMGetAllCharactersResponse.self) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let model):
        // print(String(describing: model))
        print("Total: " + String(model.info.count))
        print("Page amount: " + String(model.info.pages))
        print("Page result count: " + String(model.results.count))
    case .failure(let error):
        print(String(describing: error))
    }
}
