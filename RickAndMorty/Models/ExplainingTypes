Types ) We broke up our Types into 2 Groups because one Group, DataTypes, stores Models for Character, Location, and Episode.

We are going to leverage these Models in our APIResponseTypes.
For example, the RMGetAllCharactersResponse Struct has a nested Info Struct, but its main content is RMCharacter because it retrieves all of the characters in the database with the small difference that it has pagination.
