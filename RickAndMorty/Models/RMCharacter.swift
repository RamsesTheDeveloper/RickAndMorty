/*


-> Creating Models Section

Schema ) The schema for RMCharacter can be found at https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#character-schema


Separate Files ) Putting our Models in different files helps readability and testability.
Look through iOSSoftware for more explanation.


Filter ) Since RMCharacter has properties like RMCharacterStatus, when we receive an RMCharacter object from RMService, we will be able to implement some logic in a ViewModel that will filter out a Collection of chracters that are Alive, Dead, or unknown.
