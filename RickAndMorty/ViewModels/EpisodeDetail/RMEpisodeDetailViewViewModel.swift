-> API Cache Layer Section


fetchEpisodeData ) Once the RMEpisodeDetailViewViewModel instance is created within the RMEpisodeDetailViewController Class, we are going to call the fetchEpisodeData() Function.

Notice that the fetchEpisodeData() Function is being called within the constructor, which means that it will run right after the ViewModel is created.
 
 Even though we are dispatching another request with the endpointUrl that is passed into the ViewModel, we aren't creating a network call, we are instead using our cache.

If we wanted to make the application more performant, we could write the data that we are receiving from our execute() Function directly to disk in the case that the data does not change.

For example, if a Character was only featured in one Episode, then it would make sense to write that data to disk because that Character will not appear in any other episodes.

/*


-> Episode Detail View Section


Coming from RMEpisodeDetailViewController.
Our Episode Detail screen is shown when the user clicks on a cell in the Episodes tab or when the user cilcks on the Episode cell at the bottom of the RMCharacterDetailView.

When that happens, we want to show the details about that particular Episode.
The Rick and Morty API path for the "single episode" request returns an id, name, air_date, episode, characters, url, and created JSON objects.

The most interesting is the characters JSON object because we will use it to show the images of the Characters that appear in that Episode. Note that the characters JSON object returns an Array of URLs that point to an RMCharacter instance.



fetchEpisodeData ) As of now, we are printing out the Episode data to the console.
However, we want to hang on to that Episode data, and we want to fetch information about all the Characters that appear in that Episode.



fetchRelatedCharacters ) To receive the characters JSON object from our API request, we are going to declare a private Function called fetchRelatedCharacters() which will take an RMEpisode object.

We will call the fetchRelatedCharacters() Function inside of our execute() Function's success case.
In that case, we are going to pass in the model holding the data we are receiving from our API request.
To avoid a retention cycle, we are going to capture self in a weak capacity.

At the top of the Function, we will declare a Constant called characterUrls of Type Array of URL.
We want to access the characters property of our RMEpisode data Type, which matches our declared Type.

We will call .compactMap() on the characters property so that we can take their values and pass them into the URL initializer.
.compactMap() will return an Array of URL which we will assign to the characterUrls Constant.



requests ) Now that we have Character URL instances, we want to convert them to requests.
To do that, we will need to kick off a request for each of our Characters.

In the CharacterDetailView, we made requests to the Rick and Morty API once the user scrolled horizontally on the Episode cells.
However, in some cases we will need to batch all of the data upfront.

Our requests Constant, will be a Collection of RMRequest instances.
We will again use .compactMap() to loop over the instances of URL in characterUrls and we will return an instance of RMRequest for that URL instance.

To shorthand this :

    private func fetchRelatedCharacters(episode: RMEpisode) {
        let characterUrls: [URL] = episode.characters.compactMap {
            return URL(string: $0)
        }

        let requests: [RMRequest] = characterUrls.compactMap {
            return RMRequest(url: $0)
        }
    }

We :

    private func fetchRelatedCharacters(episode: RMEpisode) {
        let requests: [RMRequest] = episode.characters.compactMap({
            return URL(string: $0)
        }).compactMap({
            return RMRequest(url: $0)
        })
    }

Here, the first .compactMap() is creating a Collection of URLs from the characters property and then it loops over the URL instances created to instantiate RMRequest objects that are assigned to the requests Constant.



DispatchGroup ) Once we have our requests, we are going to leverage a Dispatch Group.
Conceptually, Dispatch Groups let us kick off parallel requests which send out a notification when they have completed executing.

Essentially, we send out all of the requests at the same time and we wait until all of the data has been returned.

To do so, we are going to create an instance of DispatchGroup.
Then, we are going to loop over our requests Collection, start the group by calling .enter(), and we will pass in the request index into RMService's .execute() Function.



characters ) We expect to get a Collection of RMCharacter from our .execute() Function, so outside of the For Loop, we are going to declare a characters Variable of Type Array of RMCharacter.



defer ) The defer block holds the lase line(s) of code that will run before the program's execution exits the scope of .execute().
Under the hood, group.enter() is incrementing our operation by 1 and group.leave() is decrementing it by 1 as well.

Meaning that when group.leave() catches up to group.enter(), then our program will know that it can stop executing.



dataTuple ) Once we know that our DispatchGroup is done executing, we are going to call the .notify() Function on our DispatchGroup instance and we will notify our program on the .main queue and we will specify a closure.

The closure will tell our fetchRelatedCharacters() Function what to do once the DispatchGroup is done executing.
At the top of our RMEpisodeDetailViewViewModel Class, we are going to declare a Variable called dataTuple.
Our dataTuple will be of Type RMEpisode for the Episode object and the Collection of RMCharacter objects.

Our dataTuple will be Optional.
Our dataTuple represents the two elements that we want in our global space, but we are going to make the dataTuple private and expose it with a better API later on.

Now that we have our dataTuple, we are going to call it via self and we are going to assign it the RMEpisode instance that we are receiving from the caller and the characters Variable Collection that we put together in the Function.



RMEpisodeDetailViewViewModelDelegate ) To make use of the notification that we are receiving from our DispatchGroup, we are going to leverage the Protocol-Delegate pattern.

At the top of our file we are going to declarate a Protocol called RMEpisodeDetailViewViewModelDelegate of Type AnyObject.
Inside of the RMEpisodeDetailViewViewModelDelegate Protocol, we are going to declare a Function called didFetchEpisodeDetails().
Then, we are going to create an instance within our RMEpisodeDetailViewViewModel Class.



didSet ) Once the group.notify() Function fires off, we will update our View with didSet.
Inside of didSet, we are going to call our delegate's didFetchEpisodeDetails() Function.

Head over to the RMEpisodeDetailViewController file.

-> Episode Detail Layout Section


SectionType ) Coming from RMEpisodeDetailView.
Within our RMEpisodeDetailViewViewModel Class, we are going to declare our section Types.

At the top of the Class, we are going to declare our SectionType Enum with an information case with an associated value of RMEpisodeInfoCollectionViewCellViewModel and a characters case with an associated value of RMCharacterCollectionViewCellViewModel.



RMEpisodeInfoCollectionViewCell ) The RMEpisodeInfoCollectionViewCellViewModel doesn't exist.
So, within the Views Group, we are going to create a Group called EpisodeDetails.

Within the EpisodeDetails Group we are going to create a UICollectionViewCell Cocoa Touch Class called RMEpisodeInfoCollectionViewCell.

We will also move our RMEpisodeDetailView file into the EpisodeDetails Group.

Once that is done, we are going to go into the ViewModels Group and we will create a Group Called EpisodeDetail, and we will move the RMEpisodeDetailViewViewModel into the EpisodeDetail Group.

Then, we will create a Swift file called RMEpisodeInfoCollectionViewCellViewModel within the EpisodeDetail folder.
The RMEpisodeInfoCollectionViewCellViewModel will be a Struct with public properties title and value of Type String.



sections ) We will now create a public Variable Collection of Type SectionType.
We want this Collection to be public, but we don't want the public world to set its value, so we are going to declare it public private(set), that way the property remains public, but we are not able to set its value outside of this file.

*/


/*


-> Episode Detail Cells Section


Overview ) Previously, we discussed building out the CollectionView layout for the Episode Detail Screen. 
Our Episode Detail Screen is going to have two different section Types, the first being Info and the other Characters.



RMEpisodeDetailViewViewModel ) We are going to build out the ViewModels for the Characters and Info sections.
Within our RMEpisodeDetailViewViewModel, we have an Enum called SectionType whch has two cases.

The first case is information and the second case is characters.
The information case has an associated value of RMEpisodeInfoCollectionViewCellViewModel while the characters case has an associated value of RMCharacterCollectionViewCellViewModel which we used in our previous screen(s).



dataTuple ) Once we've set up our dataTuple (meaning that we've created an instance of dataTuple elsewhere in our program), we are going to create our ViewModels.

Our dataTuple will receive ViewModels that we will use in our didSet property setter.
Our didSet property setter is going to call the createCellViewModels() Function



createCellViewModels ) We are going to take the dataTuple that we are receiving from RMEpisodeDetailViewViewModel's caller and we are going to construct our sections and store them in our sections Array.

Within our createCellViewModels() Function, we are going to fill in the sections Array.
Inside of the sections Array, we are going to use the dot operator to access the characters and information cases.

information's .init() asks for a title and value.
Our dataTuple has these values, so at the top of the createCellViewModels() Function, we are going to declare a Constant called episode and we will assign it the value of dataTuple at 1 :

    let episode = dataTuple.1

At this point in our program, we can either use the index of 1 or the index of 0.
However, we can also change our dataTuple's declaration from :

    private var dataTuple: (RMEpisode, [RMCharacter])? { ... }

To :

    private var dataTuple: (episode: RMEpisode, characters: [RMCharacter])? { ... }

We can now use the name of our argument instead of the index :

    let episode = dataTuple.episode

We can now pull values out of the episode within our information case :

    .information(viewModels: [

        .init(title: "Episode Name", value: episode.name),
        ...


    ])

For our characters case, we are going to map our Character models to instances of RMCharacterCollectionViewCellViewModel.
That concludes the creation of our ViewModels.



cellViewModels ) We are going to rename our sections Array to cellViewModels.
Now that we have our cellViewModels populating, we are going to communicate with our Delegate.

Our dataTuple is performing two tasks, the first task is creating our cellViewModels and the second task is notifying our Delegate that the episode's details have been fetched.

RMEpisodeDetailViewController is adopting our RMEpisodeDetailViewViewModelDelegate by implementing the didFetchEpisodeDetails() Function.
However, the didFetchEpisodeDetails() Function is calling our detailView's .configure() and passing in a viewModel.

The purpose of the .configure() Function is to tell the detailView to configure itself with a given viewModel.
The configure() Function is declared in the RMEpisodeDetailView Class.

The configure() Function receives the viewModel and it assigns the viewModel that it receives to the viewModel that is declared within the RMEpisodeDetailView Class.

RMEpisodeDetailView's viewModel Variable shows the collectionView once a value has been assigned to the viewModel.
However, the change we want to make is call .reloadData() before we set .isHidden to false.

/*


-> Finish Episode Details Section


createdString ) Coming from the RMEpisodeInfoCollectionViewCell file, we are going to format our date.
Within the createCellViewModels() Function, we are going to create a Variable called createdString with an initial value of empty String.

To create our date, we will access RMCharacterInfoCollectionViewCellViewModel's .dateFormatter and call the .date(from:) Function and pass in the episode's .created value which will return an Optional that will unwrap and pass into RMCharacterInfoCollectionViewCellViewModel's .shortDateFormatter .string(From) Function.

We want the user to be able to tap on a Character from the Episode detail screen and segue into the Character Detail screen.
To do that, we will need to make changes to our RMEpisodeDetailView.
Head over to the RMEpisodeDetailView file.



character ) Coming from RMEpisodeDetailView, we are going to create our character(at:) Function.
We are going to create a public Function that will take an index parameter of Type Int.

Within the Function, we are going to access the dataTuple.
In the case of not having a DataTuple, we are going to return nil, which requires that we make our return Type Optional RMCharacter.

If we do have a dataTuple, we are going to return the dataTuple's .characters at the index that we passed in.

Given that our Function's return Type is Optional, we now have to check for a value within RMEpisodeDetailView's didSelectItemAt() Function before we pass it into the delegate's .rmEpisodeDetailView().

Head over to the RMEpisodeDetailView file.
